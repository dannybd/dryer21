APIs for things we haven't written yet that we're assuming will exist:

global_storage.get_master_public_key(): Returns the bitcoin master public key.
db_client.get(token): Returns a database entry for token.
db_client.put(token=..., index=..., address=..., price=..., timestamp=...): Puts an entry into the database. Fields are passed in as keyword arguments. Throws an error on failure.

Database entry is a dictionary with the following entries:
	token, index, address, price (in satoshi), timestamp
