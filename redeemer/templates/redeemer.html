<h3 id="about">What is this?</h3>
<p>
	We provide a Tor hidden service for anonymizing bitcoin transactions while preventing even our own server from linking from and to addresses. We accomplish this through the use of "bitcoin bonds", generated through a process known as blind signing. This allows a users to purchase and redeem bonds, without us (the server) being able to link sold and redeemed bonds. Such a setup has allows Alice to send Bob a bond's worth of bitcoin, without:
	<ul>
		<li>Alice learning Bob's bitcoin address,</li>
		<li>Bob learning Alice's bitcoin address, or</li>
		<li>our server being able to link Alice's bond purchase with Bob's bond redemption.</li>
	</ul>
